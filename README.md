## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

| Area | Details |
|---|---|
| **BI Tool** | Microsoft Power BI Desktop |
| **Data Preparation** | Power Query (M) — null handling, label normalization, type casting |
| **Data Modeling** | Single flat table + DAX calculated measures |
| **DAX Measures** | `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `COUNTROWS`, `CALCULATE`, `SELECTEDVALUE` |
| **Visuals Used** | KPI cards, donut charts, horizontal bar charts, area chart, matrix table, slicers |
| **UX / Branding** | Blinkit brand palette (yellow `#F9C92A` / green `#4A7C59`), custom filter pane |
| **Interactivity** | Cross-filtering, dynamic metric toggle (4-button switcher) |

---

## ⚙️ Dynamic Metric Toggle

The dashboard features a **4-button metric switcher** that re-renders all visuals dynamically for:

| Button | Metric |
|---|---|
| `Total Sales` | Sum of all item revenue |
| `Average Sales` | Mean revenue per item |
| `Number of Items` | Count of distinct SKUs |
| `Average Rating` | Mean customer rating |

This eliminates the need for four separate report pages — one dashboard surface handles all four analytical lenses.

## 💡 Key Business Insights

| # | Insight |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Tier 3 cities outperform Tier 1** in total sales — quick-commerce demand is strongest in emerging urban markets, not metros |
| 2 | **Supermarket Type1 holds 65% of total sales** (₹787K) and 65% of SKUs — the dominant format by a wide margin |
| 3 | **Low Fat items underperform** despite health trends — gap in Low Fat assortment depth or in-app visibility |
| 4 | **Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods are tied** at ₹0.18M each — impulse snack demand rivals fresh produce |
| 5 | **2020 was the peak outlet expansion year** (205K) — pandemic acceleration followed by post-2021 consolidation |
| 6 | **Ratings are almost identical** across all outlet types (3.91–3.93) — satisfaction is uniform; differentiation lives in speed and availability |
| 7 | **Medium outlets outperform High (Large) outlets** — store size alone doesn't predict revenue; assortment and location tier matter more |
